-- Exercise 1: List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.

-- Solution:
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >
    (SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name='Romania')


-- Exercise 2: Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

-- Solution:
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
AND (gdp/population) > (SELECT (gdp/population) FROM world
                          WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')


-- Exercise 3: List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

-- Solution:
SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world
                    WHERE name = 'Argentina'
                    OR name = 'Australia')
                    ORDER BY name


-- Exercise 4: Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.

-- Solution:
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world
                    WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')
AND population < (SELECT population FROM world
                  WHERE name = 'GERMANY')


-- Exercise 5: Germany (population roughly 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

-- Solution:
SELECT name, 
CONCAT(ROUND((population * 100/(SELECT population 
                                FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'))), '%') 
AS percentage FROM world 
WHERE continent = 'Europe'


-- Exercise 6: Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

-- Solution:
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM world
             WHERE continent = 'Europe')


-- Exercise 7: Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

-- Solution:
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world AS x
WHERE area = (SELECT MAX(area) FROM world AS y
              WHERE y.continent=x.continent)


-- Exercise 8: List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

-- Solution:
SELECT continent, name FROM world x
WHERE name = (SELECT MIN(name) FROM world y
              WHERE y.continent = x.continent)


-- Exercise 9: Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

-- Solution:
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world
                    GROUP BY continent
                    HAVING MAX(population) <= 25000000)


-- Exercise 10: Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

-- Solution:
SELECT name, continent FROM world x
WHERE population > 3 * (SELECT MAX(y.population) FROM world y
                        WHERE y.continent = x.continent
                        AND y.name <> x.name)
